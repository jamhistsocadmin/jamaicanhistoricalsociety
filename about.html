    <h2>History of the Society</h2>
    <p>On the 22nd April, 1943 Mr. C.B. Lewis, Mr. H. Paget, Mr. H.E. Vendryes and Mr. J.G. Young met at the offices of The British Council to initiate the formation of The Jamaican Historical Society. They decided that the Society should be non-political and non-sectarian and its aims should be to encourage the objective study of history in Jamaica and to work for the preservation of monuments and other historical material. It was also decided to undertake the publication of a Jamaican Historical Review twice a year, in June and December.</p>

<p>A list of persons deemed to be interested in the serious and objective study of history was compiled and these persons were invited to attend a meeting at the office of The British Council on May the 26th, 1943. The persons present at that meeting unanimously agreed to resolve themselves into The Jamaican Historical Society. An Executive Committee was elected, with Sir Noel Livingston as President, and tasked with drafting the Constitution of the Society. The Constitution and By-Laws of the Society were ratified at a General Meeting of the Society on January 11th, 1944.</p>

<p>The Governor of Jamaica, Sir John Huggins, the former Governor, Sir Arthur Richards who had commissioned a list of monuments and objects of historic interest in the island and the Chief Representative of The British Council in the Caribbean, Sir Harry Luke all agreed to be Patrons of the Society.</p>

<p>Persons with a keen interest in history and historians alike now had, in the Society, a forum where papers on historical subjects could be presented for discussion and review on a regularly scheduled basis. A regular series of radio broadcasts was also initiated. The radio broadcasts were invaluable in disseminating knowledge of, and stimulating interest in, Jamaica's history.</p>

<p>The publication by the Society, of The Jamaican Historical Review, was made possible by a substantial grant from the British Council. Other publications on Jamaican history soon followed.</p>

<p>Three years later, in 1946, the Jamaican Historical Society together with the British Council invited Mr. Angus Acworth of the Georgian Group in England to visit Jamaica. The resulting report by Acworth on 'Buildings of Architectural or Historic Interest in the British West Indies' was published by H.M. Stationery Office as Colonial Research Studies No. 2 in 1951. It included draft legislation for 'the preservation of the National Buildings in Jamaica'.</p>

<p>Their efforts were rewarded and repairs were effected to a number of monuments by the Ministry of Communications & Works. Their main achievement however was the passing of Law No. 72 of 1958 which brought into being the Jamaica National Trust Commission. In 1985 a new law changed the name of the Jamaica National Trust Commission to the Jamaica National Heritage Trust (JNHT) and enlarged its functions.</p>

<p>Over the years members have endeavoured to fulfill the objects of the Society in a variety of ways: by placing historical markers to commemorate a person or an event; correcting errors in articles that appear in the newspapers; offering field trips to places of historical interest and hosting talks and panel discussions.</p>
